          <h4>Chapter 4: Lazy Evaluation with Generators</h4>
          <p>
            Lazy evaluation is a programming technique, which is used when we
            don't want to compute values until the very last second. This way,
            we're sure we actually need it. The opposite approach, eager
            evaluation, has the potential to compute several values that aren't
            needed. This generally isn't a problem, until the size and
            complexity of our applications grow beyond a level where these
            wasted computations are imperceptible to the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <em>Generator</em> is a new primitive type introduced to
            JavaScript as a part of the ES6 specification of the language.
            Generators help us implement lazy evaluation techniques in our code,
            and as a corollary, help us implement the
            <span class="term" data-term="conserve"
              >conserve concurrency principle</span
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll start the chapter off with some simple introductions to
            generators, so we can get a feel for how they behave. From there,
            we'll move onto more advanced lazy evaluation scenarios, wrapping up
            the chapter with a look at coroutines. Let's get started.
          </p>

          <div id="call-stacks-and-memory-allocation">
            <h5>Call stacks and memory allocation</h5>
            <p>
              Memory allocation is a necessity of any programming language.
              Without this, we have no data structures to work with, not even
              primitive types. Memory is cheap, and it seems that there's plenty
              of it to go around; this isn't cause for celebration just yet.
              While it's more feasible today to allocate larger data structures
              in memory then it was 10 years ago, we still have to deallocate
              that memory when we're done with it. JavaScript is a
              garbage-collected language, which means our code doesn't have to
              explicitly destroy objects in memory. However, the garbage
              collector incurs a CPU penalty.
            </p>
            <p>
              So there are two factors in play here. We want to conserve two
              resources here, and we'll try to do so using generators to
              implement lazy evaluation. We don't want to allocate memory
              unnecessarily, and if we can avoid this, then we can avoid
              invoking the garbage collector frequently. In this section, I'll
              introduce some generator concepts.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="bookmarking-function-contexts">
            <h5>Bookmarking function contexts</h5>
            <p>
              In a normal function call stack, a function returns a value. The
              <em>return</em> statement activates a new execution context and
              discards the old context because we returned, so we're done with
              it. Generator functions are a special kind of JavaScript function
              denoted with their own syntax, and their call stacks aren't so
              cut-and-dried compared to <em>return</em> statements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as the <em>return</em> statement passes a value to the
              calling context, the <em>yield</em> statement passes a value back.
              However, unlike a regular function, generator function contexts
              aren't discarded. In fact, they're bookmarked so that when control
              is given back to the generator context, it can pick up where it
              left off to continue yielding values until it's done. This
              bookmarking data is very insignificant, as it just points to a
              location in our code.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="sequences-instead-of-arrays">
            <h5>Sequences instead of arrays</h5>
            <p>
              In JavaScript, when we need to iterate over a list of things,
              numbers, strings, objects, and so on, we use an array. Arrays are
              general purpose and powerful. The challenge with arrays in the
              context of lazy evaluation is that arrays themselves are data that
              need to be allocated. So we have the elements within the array
              that need to be allocated somewhere in memory, and we also have
              metadata about the elements in the array.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we're working with a large number of objects, the memory
              overhead associated with the array is significant. Additionally,
              we need to somehow put these objects in the array. This is an
              additional step that adds CPU time. An alternative concept is a
              sequence. Sequences aren't a tangible JavaScript language
              construct. They're an abstract concept—arrays without actually
              allocating arrays. Sequences help with lazy evaluation. For this
              exact reason, there's nothing to allocate, and there's no initial
              population step.
            </p>
            <p>
              With sequences, we don't have an explicit container structure for
              the objects that we're interested in iterating over. The only
              overhead associated with a sequence is the pointer to the current
              item. We can use generator functions as a mechanism for generating
              sequences in JavaScript. As we saw in the preceding section,
              generators bookmark their execution context when they yield values
              back to the caller. This is the kind of minimal overhead that
              we're looking for. It enables us to lazily evaluate objects and
              iterate over them as a sequence.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="creating-generators-and-yielding-values">
            <h5>Creating generators and yielding values</h5>
            <p>
              In this section, I'll introduce the generator function syntax, and
              we'll walk through yielding values from a generator. We'll also
              look at the two approaches that we can use to iterate over values
              yielded from generators.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="generator-function-syntax">
            <h5>Generator function syntax</h5>
            <p>
              The syntax for generator functions is nearly identical to normal
              functions. The difference in the declaration is that the
              <em>function</em> keyword is followed by an asterisk. The more
              profound difference is the return value, which is always a
              generator instance. Moreover, there's no need for the
              <em>new</em> keyword, despite a new object being created. Let's
              take a look at what a generator function looks like:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet1">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              It's highly unlikely that we'd ever use generators in this
              fashion, but it's a good way to illustrate the nuances of
              generator functions. For example, <em>return</em> statements are
              perfectly valid within generator functions, and yet, they produce
              a completely different result for the caller, as we can see. In
              practice, we're far more likely to encounter
              <em>yield</em> statements in generators, so let's look at them
              next.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="yielding-values">
            <h5>Yielding values</h5>
            <p>
              The common case with generator functions is to yield values and
              control back to the caller. Yielding control back to the caller is
              a defining characteristic of generators. When we yield, the
              generator bookmarks our position in the code. It does this because
              the caller is likely going to request another value from the
              generator, and when it does, the generator simply picks up where
              it left off. Let's take a look at a generator function that yields
              several times:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet2">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              The previous code is what a sequence looks like. We have three
              values, and they're sequentially yielded from our function.
              They're not put in any kind of container structure either. The
              first call to <em>yield</em> passes <em>"first"</em> to
              <em>next()</em>, which is where it's used. The same goes for the
              other two values. In fact, this is lazy evaluation in action. We
              have three calls to <em>console.log()</em>. The eager
              implementation of <em>gen()</em> would return a collection of
              values for us to log. Instead, when we need to log a value, we go
              and get it from the generator. This is the laziness factor; we
              conserve our efforts until they're actually required, avoiding
              allocations and computations. The not-so-ideal aspect of our
              previous example is that we're actually repeating calls to
              <em>console.log()</em>, when really, we want to iterate over the
              sequence, calling <em>console.log()</em> for each item in it.
              Let's iterate over some generator sequences now.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="iterating-over-generators">
            <h5>Iterating over generators</h5>
            <p>
              The <em>next()</em> method gets us, not surprisingly, the next
              value in the generator sequence. The actual value returned by
              <em>next()</em> is an object with two properties: the yielded
              value and whether or not the generator is <em>done</em>. However,
              we generally don't want to hard-code our calls to <em>next()</em>.
              Instead, we want to call it iteratively as values are yielded from
              the generator. Here's an example that uses a <em>while</em> loop
              to iterate over a generator:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet3">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This loop will continue until the <em>done</em> property of the
              yielded item is <em>true</em>; at this point, we know there aren't
              any items, and thus, we can stop. This allows us to iterate over a
              sequence of yielded values without the need to create an array for
              the sole purpose of iterating over it. However, there's a lot of
              boilerplate code in this loop that has more to do with managing
              the generator iteration than actually iterating over it. Let's
              take a look at another approach:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet4">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is much better. We've condensed our code down into something
              that's much more focused on the task at hand. This code
              essentially does the exact same thing as our <em>while</em> loop,
              except the <em>for..of</em> statement, which understands what to
              do when the iterable is a generator. Iterating over generators is
              a common pattern in concurrent JavaScript applications, so
              optimizing for compact and readable code here would be a wise
              decision.

          <div id="infinite-sequences">
            <h5>Infinite sequences</h5>
            <p>
              Some sequences are infinite, prime numbers, Fibonacci numbers, odd
              numbers, and so on. Infinite sequences aren't limited to sets of
              numbers; more abstract notions can be considered infinite. For
              example, a set of stings that repeats itself infinitely, a Boolean
              value that toggles infinitely, and so on. In this section, we'll
              explore how generators make it possible for us to work with
              infinite sequences.

              Allocating items from an infinite sequence isn't practical from a
              memory consumption point of view. In fact, it's not even possible
              to allocate the whole sequence—it's infinite. Memory is finite.
              So, it's better to simply sidestep the whole allocation problem
              entirely and use a generator to yield the values from the sequence
              as we need them. At any given point in time, our application is
              only going to use a tiny slice of the infinite sequence. Let's
              take a look at some generator code that lazily produces items from
              an infinite Fibonacci sequence:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet5">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div id="alternating-sequences">
            <h5>Alternating sequences</h5>
            <p>
              A variation on infinite sequences is either a circular sequence or
              an alternating sequence. These types of sequences are circular
              when the end is reached; they start from the beginning. These
              types of sequences will continue to generate values infinitely.
              This becomes useful when we have a set of rules that determine how
              the sequence is defined and the set of items that's generated;
              then, we start this set all over again. Now, let's look at some
              code to see the implementation of these sequences using
              generators. Here's a generic generator function that we can use to
              alternate between values:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet6">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is the first time we've declared a generator function that
              accepts arguments. In fact, we're using the spread operator to
              iterate over arguments passed to the function. Unlike arguments,
              the <em>seq</em> argument that we've created using the spread
              operator is a real array. As we iterate over this array, we yield
              each item from the generator. This may not seem all that useful at
              first glance, but it's the <em>while</em> loop that adds the real
              power here. Since the <em>while</em> loop will never exit, the
              <em>for</em> loop will simply repeat itself. That is, it'll
              alternate. This negates the need for explicit bookkeeping code
              (Have we reached the end of the sequence? How do we reset the
              counter and move back to the beginning? And so on). Let's see how
              this generator function works:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet7">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Cool. So the <em>alternator</em> will continue to generate
              <em>true</em>/<em>false</em> values as long as we continue to ask
              for them. The main benefit here is that we don't need to know
              about the next value, <em>alternator</em> takes care of this for
              us. Let's look at this generator function with a different
              sequence to iterate over:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet8">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As we can see, the <em>alternate()</em> function comes in handy
              for alternating between any arguments passed to it.
            </p>

          <div id="deferring-to-other-generators">
            <h5>Deferring to other generators</h5>
            <p>
              We've seen how the <em>yield</em> statement is able to pause the
              execution context of a <em>generator</em> function, and yield a
              value back to the calling context. There's a variation on the
              <em>yield</em> statement that allows us to defer to other
              <em>generator</em> functions. Another technique involves creating
              a mesh of generators by interweaving several generator sources
              together. In this section, we'll explore both of these ideas.

          <div id="selecting-a-strategy">
            <h5>Selecting a strategy</h5>
            <p>
              Deferring to other generators gives our functions the ability to
              decide at run-time, to hand off control from one generator to
              another. In other words, it allows the selection of a more
              appropriate generator function based on a strategy. What we have
              here are three specialized generators that we would like to use
              throughout our application. That is, they each work in their own
              unique way. Perhaps, they're tailored for specific types of
              inputs. However, these generators simply make assumptions about
              the input that they're given. It may not be the best tool for the
              job, and so, we have to figure out which of these generators to
              use. What we want to avoid is having to implement this strategy
              selection code all over the place. It would be nice if we were
              able to encapsulate all of this into a general purpose generator
              that captures common cases throughout our code. Let's say that we
              have the following generator functions, and they're equally used
              throughout our application:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet9">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              These are small and concise functions, and they are easy to use
              wherever we need them. The trouble is that each of these functions
              make assumptions about the collection that's passed in. Is it an
              array of objects, each with a specific property? Is it an array of
              strings? Is it an object instead of an array? Since these
              generator functions are commonly used throughout our code for a
              similar purpose, we can implement a more generic iterator, who's
              job is to determine the best generator function to use, and then
              to defer to it. Let's see what this function looks like:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet10">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Think of the <em>iterateNames()</em> function as a simple proxy
              for any one of the other three generators. It examines the input
              and makes a selection based on the collection. We could have
              implemented one large generator function, but that would preclude
              us from use cases where we want to use the smaller generators
              directly. What if we want to use them to compose new
              functionality, or if another composite generator wants to use it?
              It's always a good idea to keep generator functions small and
              focused. The <em>yield*</em> syntax allows us to handoff control
              to a more suitable generator. Now, let's see how this general
              purpose generator function is put to use by deferring to
              generators that are best equipped to handle the data:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet11">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>

          </div>

          <div id="interweaving-generators">
            <h5>Interweaving generators</h5>
            <p>
              When a generator defers to another generator, control isn't handed
              back to the first generator until the second generator is
              completely finished. In the preceding example, our generator
              simply looked for a better generator to carry out the work.
              However, there will be other times when we'll have two or more
              data sources that we want to use together. So, instead of handing
              off control to one generator, then to another and so on, we would
              alternate between the various sources, taking turns consuming
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is to round-robin the data sources, rather than to empty
              one source, then another, and so on. A generator like this is
              handy when there isn't a single large collection for us to work
              with, but instead, two or more collections. Using this generator
              technique, we can actually treat multiple data sources as though
              they were one big source, but without having to allocate the
              memory for a large structure. Let's look at the following code
              example:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet12">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>

            <p>
              The <em>yield</em> statement doesn't just yield control back to
              the caller, it also returns a value. This value is passed to the
              generator function through the <em>next()</em> method. This is how
              we pass data into generators after they've been created. In this
              section, we'll address the bidirectional aspect of generators, and
              how creating feedback loops can produce some lean code.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="reusing-generators">
            <h5>Reusing generators</h5>
            <p>
              Some generators are general purpose and used frequently throughout
              our code. This being the case, does it make sense to constantly
              create and destroy these generator instances? Or can we reuse
              them? For instance, consider a sequence that's mainly dependent on
              initial conditions. Let's say we want to generate a sequence of
              even numbers. We would start at two, and as we iterate over this
              generator, the value would be incremented. The next time we want
              to iterate over even numbers, we would have to create a new
              generator.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is kind of wasteful, since all we're doing is resetting a
              counter. What if we took a different approach, one that would
              allow us to keep on using the same generator instance for these
              types of sequences? The <em>next()</em> method of generators is a
              possible implementation path for this capability. We could pass it
              a value, which would then reset our counter. So instead of having
              to create a new generator instance every time we need to iterate
              over even numbers, we can simply call <em>next()</em> with a value
              that resets the initial conditions of our generator.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>yield</em> keyword actually returns a value—the argument
              that's passed to <em>next()</em>. Most of the time, this is
              <em>undefined</em>, such as when the generator is iterated over in
              a <em>for..of</em> loop. However, this is how we're able to pass
              arguments to the generator after it starts running. This is not
              the same thing as passing arguments to the generator function,
              which comes in handy for doing the initial configuration of the
              generator. Values passed to <em>next()</em> are how we talk to the
              generator when we need to change something for the next value
              that's to be generated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's take a look at how we can use the <em>next()</em> method to
              create a reusable even number sequence generator:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet13">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>

            <p>
              <em>
                In case you're wondering why we're not using a for..of loop in
                the favor of a while loop, it's because you use a for..of loop
                to iterate over a generator. When you do so, the generator gets
                marked as done as soon as the loop exits. Hence, it would no
                longer be usable.

          <div id="lightweight-map-reduce">
            <h5>Lightweight map/reduce</h5>
            <p>
              Something else we can do with the <em>next()</em> method is map
              one value to another. For example, let's say we had a collection
              containing seven items. To map these items, we would iterate over
              the collection, passing each item to <em>next()</em>. As we saw in
              the preceding section, this method can reset the state of a
              generator, but it can also be used to supply a stream of input
              data, just as it supplies a stream of output data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's see if we can write some code that does this—map collection
              items by feeding them into a generator through <em>next()</em>:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet14">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As we can see, this is indeed possible. We're able to perform a
              lightweight map/reduce job using this approach. The mapper
              generator has the <em>iteratee</em> function that's applied to
              every item in the collection. As we iterate over the array, we're
              able to feed items into the generator by passing them to the
              <em>next()</em> method as an argument.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, there's something about the previous method that just doesn't
              feel optimal—having to bootstrap the generator like this, and
              explicitly calling <em>next()</em> for every iteration feels
              clunky. In fact, could we not apply the <em>iteratee</em> function
              directly, instead of calling <em>next()</em>? It's these things
              that we need to be on the lookout while using generators; in
              particular, when passing data to generators. Just because we're
              able to, doesn't mean that it's a good idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mapping and reducing would probably feel more natural, if we were
              to simply iterate over the generator just as we do with all other
              generators. We still want the lightweight mapping that generators
              give us, to avoid the memory allocations. Let's try a different
              approach here—one that doesn't require the <em>next()</em> method:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet15">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This looks like an improvement. There's less code, and the flow of
              the generator is easy to grok. The difference is that we pass our
              array and <em>iteratee</em> function to the generator up front.
              Then, as we iterate over the generator, each item gets mapped
              lazily. The code that reduces this array into an object is simpler
              to read too.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>genMap()</em> function that we've just implemented is
              generic, which is advantageous to us. In real applications,
              mappings are going to be more complex than an uppercase
              transformation. More likely, there will be multiple levels of
              mappings. That is, we map the collection, then map it N more times
              before reducing it. If we've done a good job designing our code,
              then we'll want to compose generators out of smaller iterated
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              But how can we keep this generic and lazy? The idea is to have
              several generators, each serving as the input to the next. This
              means that as our reducer code iterates over these generators,
              only one item makes it's way through the various layers of
              mappings, to the reduction code. Let's take a stab at implementing
              this:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet16">

            <h5>Coroutines</h5>
            <p>
              Coroutines are a concurrency technique that allow for cooperative
              multitasking. What this means is that if one part of our
              application needs to perform part of a task, it can do so, and
              then hand control off to another part of the application. Think
              about a subroutine, or in more recent times, a function. These
              subroutines often rely on other subroutines. However, they don't
              just run in succession, they cooperate with one another.

            <p>
              In JavaScript, there's no intrinsic coroutine mechanism.
              Generators aren't coroutines, but they have similar properties.
              For example, generators can pause the execution of a function,
              yielding control to another context, then regain control and
              resume. This gets us partway there, but generators are for
              generating values, which isn't necessarily what we're after with
              coroutines. In this section, we'll look at some techniques for
              implementing coroutines in JavaScript using generators.

              Generators give us most of what we need to implement
              <em>coroutine</em> functions in JavaScript; they can pause and
              resume executing. We just need to implement some minor
              abstractions around generators so that the functions that we're
              working with actually feel like calling
              <em>coroutine</em> functions, instead of iterating over
              generators.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is that invoking the <em>coroutine</em> function moves
              from one <em>yield</em> statement to the next. And we can supply
              input to the coroutine by passing an argument, which is then
              returned by the <em>yield</em> statement. This is a lot to
              remember, so let's generalize these coroutine concepts in a
              function wrapper:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet17">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Pretty simple—five lines of code, but it's also powerful. The
              function returned by Harold's wrapper simply advances the
              generator to the next <em>yield</em> statement, supplying the
              argument to <em>next()</em>, if one was provided. It's one thing
              to make claims of utility, but let's actually use this thing to
              make a <em>coroutine</em> function:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet18">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              When there are a series of steps involved with fulfilling some
              task, we typically require bookkeeping code, temporary values, and
              so on. These aren't necessary with coroutines because the function
              simply pauses, leaving any local state intact. In other words,
              there's no need to intertwine concurrency logic with our
              application logic when coroutines do a decent job of hiding these
              details for us.

          <div id="handling-dom-events">
            <h5>Handling DOM events</h5>
            <p>
              Somewhere else where we can use coroutines is with the DOM as
              event handlers. This works by adding the same
              <em>coroutine()</em> function as an event listener to several
              elements. Let's recall that each call to these coroutine functions
              talks to a single generator. This means that our coroutines that
              are setup to handle DOM events get passed in as a stream. It's
              almost like we're iterating over these events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since these <em>coroutine</em> functions use the same generator,
              it's easy for elements to talk to one another using this
              technique. The typical approach to DOM events involves callback
              functions that talk to some sort of central source that's shared
              among elements and maintains state. With coroutines, the state of
              element communications is implicit inside our function code. Let's
              use our coroutine wrapper in the context of DOM event handlers:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet19">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><div class="position-absolute" style="top: 0; right: 0;"><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none" coroutine>Co1</button><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none" coroutine>Co2</button></div></pre>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div id="handling-promised-values">
            <h5>Handling promised values</h5>
            <p>
              In the preceding section, we saw how the
              <em>coroutine()</em> function can be used to process DOM events.
              Instead of haphazardly adding callback functions that respond to
              DOM events, we use the same <em>coroutine()</em> function, which
              treats events as a stream of data. It's easier for DOM event
              handlers to cooperate with one another since they share the same
              generator context.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can apply this same principle to <em>then()</em> callbacks of
              promises, which works in a similar way to the DOM coroutine
              approach. Instead of passing a regular function, we pass a
              coroutine to <em>then()</em>. When the promise resolves, the
              <em>coroutine</em> advances to the next <em>yield</em> statement
              along with a resolved value. Let's take a look at the following
              code:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet20">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This is very useful because it provides something that static
              promise methods do not. The <em>Promise.all()</em> method forces
              us to wait for all the promises to resolve before resolving the
              returned promise. However, in the case where the resolved promise
              values aren't dependent on one another, we can simply iterate over
              them, responding as they resolve in any order.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can achieve something similar by attaching plain functions to
              <em>then()</em> as callbacks, but then, we wouldn't have a shared
              context for promise values as they resolve. Another tactic we can
              adopt by combining promises with coroutines is to declare a
              handful of coroutines that respond differently, depending on the
              type of data they're responding to. These coroutines would then
              live on throughout the entire duration of the application, being
              passed to promises as they get created.
