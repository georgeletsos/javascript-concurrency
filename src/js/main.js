  parallelize:
    "The parallelize principle means taking advantage of modern CPU capabilities to compute results in less time. This is now possible in any modern browser, by using web workers, or NodeJS environment, by spawning new processes. The real benefit is that we can compute using larger data sets as input, and have a smaller opportunity of an unresponsive user experience due to long-running JavaScript.",
  synchronize:
    "The synchronize principle is about the mechanisms used to coordinate concurrent actions and the abstractions of those mechanisms. Callback functions is the obvious tool of choice when we need to run some code, but we don't want to run it now. Keep in mind that callbacks fall apart when there are plenty them, and lots of dependencies between them.",
  conserve:
    "The conserve principle is about saving on compute and memory resources. This is done by using lazy evaluation techniques, meaning we don't actually compute a new value until we're sure we actually need it. ",
  executionEnvironment:
    "This container gets created whenever a new web page is opened. It's the all-encompassing environment, which has everything that our JavaScript code will interact with. It also serves as a sandboxâ€”our JavaScript code can't reach outside of this environment.",
  javascriptInterpreter:
    "This is the component that's responsible for parsing and executing our JavaScript source code. It's the browser's job to augment the interpreter with globals, such as window, and XMLHttpRequest.",
  taskQueue:
    "Tasks are queued whenever something needs to happen. An execution environment has at least one of these queues, but typically, it has several of them.",
  eventLoop:
    "An execution environment has a single event loop that's responsible for servicing all task queues. There's only one event loop, because there's only one thread.",
  executor:
    "The executor function is responsible for somehow resolving the value that the caller is waiting for. This function is called immediately after the promise is created. It takes two arguments: a resolver function and a rejector function.",
  resolver:
    "It's the first argument passed to the executor function, which can be called from anywhere. When it's called, the promise moves into a fulfilled state. This change in state will trigger any then() callbacks.",
  rejector:
    "It's the second argument passed to the executor function, which can be called from anywhere as well. When it's called, it changes the state of the promise from pending to rejected. This state change will call the error callback function, if any, passed to then() or catch().",
  thenable:
    "An object is thenable if it has a then() method that accepts a fulfillment callback and a rejection callback as arguments. In other words, a promise is thenable.",
  referentialTransparency:
    "Referential transparency means that given the same object as input, no matter how many times it's called, the function will always return the same result."
