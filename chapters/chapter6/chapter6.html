          <h4>Chapter 6: Practical Parallelism</h4>
          <p>
            In the previous chapter, we walked through the basic capabilities of
            web workers. We used web workers for true parallelism in the browser
            because they map to real threads, which in turn, map to separate
            CPUs. This chapter builds on the last, providing some motivation for
            designing parallel code in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll start with a brief look at some ideas borrowed from functional
            programming, and how they're a nice fit for concurrency problems.
            Then, we'll tackle the problem of parallel validity by either making
            the decision to compute in parallel, or to simply run on one CPU.
            Then, we'll go in depth on some concurrency problems that would
            benefit from tasks running in parallel. We'll also address the
            problem of keeping the DOM responsive using workers.

            <h5>Functional programming</h5>
            <p>
              Functions are obviously central to functional programming. But
              then, so is the data that flows through our application. In fact,
              the data and its movement in a program is probably just as
              important as the implementation of the functions themselves, at
              least as far application design is concerned.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a strong affinity between functional programming and
              concurrent programming. In this section, we'll look at why this
              is, and how we can apply functional programming techniques that
              can result in stronger concurrent code.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="data-in-data-out">
            <h5>Data in, data out</h5>
            <p>
              Functional programming is just as powerful as other programming
              paradigms. It's a different way of tackling the same problems. We
              use a different set of tools. For example, functions are the
              building blocks, and we'll use them to build our abstractions
              around data transformations. Imperative programming, on the other
              hand, uses constructs, such as classes to build abstractions. The
              fundamental difference is that classes and objects like to
              encapsulate the state of something, while functions are data in,
              data out.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, let's say we had a user object with an
              <em>enabled</em> property. The idea is that the
              <em>enabled</em> property has a value, which can change at any
              given time. In other words, the user changes state. If we were to
              pass this object around to different areas of our application,
              then the state is also passed along with it. It's encapsulated as
              a property. Any one of these components that ends up with a
              reference to the user object can change it, and then pass it
              somewhere else. And so on, and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not like this in functional programming. State isn't
              encapsulated inside objects and passed around from component to
              component; not because doing so is inherently bad, but because
              it's just a different way of addressing the problem. Where state
              encapsulation is a goal of object-oriented programming, getting
              from point A to point B and transforming data along the way is
              what functional programming is all about. There's no point Câ€”once
              the function has done its job, it doesn't care about the state of
              the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead the functional approach creates a new object with the
              updated property value. The function takes data as input and
              returns new data as output. In other words, it doesn't modify the
              input. It's a simple idea, but one with important consequences,
              such as immutability.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="immutability">
            <h5>Immutability</h5>
            <p>
              Immutable data is a key functional programming concept and one
              that fits nicely into concurrent programming. JavaScript is a
              multi-paradigm language. That is, it's functional, but it can also
              be imperative. Some functional programming languages strictly
              enforce immutabilityâ€”you simply cannot change the state of an
              object. It's actually nice to have the flexibility of choosing
              when to keep data immutable and when it makes sense not to.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the last example of the previous section, it was noted that a
              function should actually return a brand new object with a property
              value that's different from the input value. This is done to avoid
              mutating the input value. Although, this may seem wastefulâ€”
              constantly creating objects on the fly, but it really isn't.
              Consider all the bookkeeping code that we don't have to write when
              an object never changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if the <em>enabled</em> property of a user is
              mutable, then this means any component that uses this object needs
              to constantly check the <em>enabled</em> property. This check
              needs to happen whenever a component wants to show the user. We
              actually need to perform this same check using the functional
              approach. If some part in our system can change the
              <em>enabled</em> property, then we have to worry about that.
              Eliminating that part also eliminates a host of other
              complexities. These are called side-effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Side-effects and concurrency don't get along well. In fact, it's
              the very idea that an object can change at all that makes
              concurrency hard. For example, let's say we have two threads that
              want to access our user object. They first need to acquire access
              to it, but it might already be locked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us suppose that the first thread locks the user object,
              preventing other threads from accessing it. The second thread
              needs to wait until it's unlocked before it can continue. This is
              called resource contention, and it diminishes the whole purpose of
              utilizing multiple CPUs. The threads aren't truly running in
              parallel if they're waiting for access to some kind of resource.
              Immutability side-steps the resource contention issue because
              there's no need to lock resources that don't change.
            </p>
            <p>
              When objects don't change state, any number of threads can access
              them concurrently without any risk of corrupting the state of an
              object due to out-of-order operations and without wasting valuable
              CPU time waiting on resources.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="referential-transparency-and-time">
            <h5>Referential transparency and time</h5>
            <p>
              Functions that take immutable data as input have something called
              referential transparency. This means that given the same object as
              input, no matter how many times it's called, the function will
              always return the same result. This is a useful property because
              it means that temporal factors are removed from the picture. That
              is, the only factor that can change the result of the function's
              output, is its inputâ€”not when it's called relative to other
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Put another way, referentially-transparent functions don't produce
              side-effects because they work with immutable data. And because of
              this and the lack of time being a factor for function output,
              they're well-suited in a concurrent context. Let's take a look at
              a function that isn't referentially-transparent:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet1">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              The way the <em>getName()</em> function works depends on the state
              of the <em>user</em> object that's passed to it. If the user
              object is enabled, we return the name. Otherwise, we don't return
              anything. This means that the function isn't
              <span class="term" data-term="referentialTransparency"
                >referentially transparent</span
              >
              if it passes mutable data structures, which is the case in the
              preceding example. The <em>enabled</em> property changes, and so
              does the result of the function. Let's fix this situation and make
              it referentially-transparent with the following code:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet2">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As we can see, the <em>updateUserRT()</em> function doesn't
              actually change the data. It creates a copy that includes the
              updated property value. This means that we're safe to call
              <em>updateUser()</em> with the original user object as input at
              any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              This functional programming technique helps us write concurrent
              code because the order in which we execute operations isn't a
              factor. Ordering asynchronous operations is hard. Immutable data
              leads to
              <span class="term" data-term="referentialTransparency"
                >referential transparency</span
              >, which leads to stronger concurrency semantics.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="do-we-need-to-go-parallel">
            <h5>Do we need to go parallel?</h5>
            <p>
              Parallelism can be hugely beneficial to us for the right sort of
              problems. Creating workers and synchronizing the communication
              between them to carry out tasks isn't free. For example, we could
              have this nice, well thought-out parallel code that utilizes four
              CPU cores. But it turns out that the time spent executing the
              boilerplate code to facilitate this parallelism exceeds the cost
              of simply processing the data in a single thread.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this section, we'll address the issues associated with
              validating the data that we're processing and determining the
              hardware capabilities of the system. We'll always want to have a
              synchronous fallback option for the scenarios where parallel
              execution simply doesn't make sense. When we decide to go
              parallel, our next job is to figure out exactly how the work gets
              distributed to workers. All of these checks are performed at
              runtime.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="how-big-is-the-data">
            <h5>How big is the data?</h5>
            <p>
              Sometimes, going parallel just isn't worthwhile. The idea with
              parallelism is to compute more in less time. This gets our results
              faster, ultimately leading to a more responsive user experience.
              Having said that, there are scenarios where the data that we
              process simply does not justify the use of threads. Even some
              large collections of data may not stand to benefit from
              parallelization.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two factors that determine how suitable a given operation is
              for parallel execution are the size of the data and the time
              complexity of the operation that we perform on each item in the
              collection. Put differently, if we have an array with thousands of
              objects in it, but the computation performed on each object is
              cheap, then there's no real motivation to go parallel. Likewise,
              we can have an array with very few objects, but the operation is
              expensive. Again, we may not benefit from subdividing the work
              into smaller tasks then distributing them to worker threads.
            </p>
            <p>
              The static factor is the computation that we perform on individual
              items. At design time, we have to have a general idea of whether
              the code is expensive or cheap in terms of CPU cycles. This might
              require some static analysis, some quick benchmarks, or just a
              glance mixed with know-how and intuition. When we devise our
              criteria for determining whether a given operation is well-suited
              for parallel execution or not, we need to combine the computation
              itself with the size of the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's take a look at an example that uses different performance
              characteristics to determine whether or not a given function
              should be executed in parallel:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet3">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This function is handy because it's an easy preflight check for us
              to performâ€”either it's parallel or it isn't. If it's not, then we
              can take the short path of simply computing the result and
              returning it to the caller. If it's parallel, then we'll move onto
              the next stage of figuring out how to subdivide the operation into
              smaller tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>isConcurrent()</em> function takes into consideration not
              only the size of the data, but also the cost of performing a
              computation on any one of the data items. This lets us fine-tune
              the concurrency of our application. If there's too much overhead,
              we can increase the parallel processing threshold. If we've made
              some changes to our code that make a previously inexpensive
              function, expensive. We just need to change the
              <em>expensiveTask</em> flag in this scenario.

                for our workers? We obviously want to avoid this, so we need to

            <h5>Hardware concurrency capabilities</h5>
            <p>
              Another high-level check that we'll perform in our concurrent
              applications is the concurrency capabilities of the hardware that
              we're running on. This informs us how many web workers to create.
              For example, there's really nothing for us to gain by creating 32
              web workers on a system where there are only four CPU cores. On
              this system, four web workers would be more appropriate. So, how
              do we get this number?
            </p>
            <p>Let's create a generic function that figures this out for us:</p>
            <div class="snippet4">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Since not all browsers implement the
              <em>navigator.hardwareConcurrency</em> property, we have to take
              this into consideration. If we don't know the exact hardware
              concurrency level, we have to make a guess. Here, we say that four
              is the most common CPU core count that we're likely to encounter.
              And since this is a default argument value, it is used for both:
              special-case handling by the caller and easy global changes.

                technique, but not suitable for production applications because
                of the overhead and general uncertainty that's involved. In
                other words, using a static value that covers the majority of
                our users' systems is good enough.</em

          <div id="creating-tasks-and-assigning-work">
            <h5>Creating tasks and assigning work</h5>
            <p>
              Once we've decided that a given operation should be performed in
              parallel, and we know how many workers to create based on the
              concurrency level, it's time to create some tasks, and assign them
              to workers. Essentially, this means slicing up the input data into
              smaller chunks and passing these to the workers that apply our
              task to a subset of the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the preceding chapter, we saw our first example of taking input
              data and diving it into tasks. Once the work was divided, we
              spawned a new worker and terminated it when the task was complete.
              Creating and terminating threads like this may not be the ideal
              approach depending on the type of application we're building. For
              example, if we occasionally run an expensive operation that would
              benefit from parallel processing, then it might make sense to
              spawn workers on demand. However, if we frequently process things
              in parallel, then it might make more sense to spawn threads when
              the application starts, and reuse them for processing many types
              of tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              This configuration allows operations to send messages to worker
              threads that are already running and get results back. There's no
              overhead associated with spawning new workers and cleaning them up
              when we're done with them. There is still the problem of
              reconciliation. We've split the operation into smaller tasks, each
              returning their own result. However, the operation is expected to
              return a single result. So when we split work into smaller tasks,
              we also need a way to join the task results back into a cohesive
              whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's write a generic function that handles the boilerplate
              aspects of splitting work into tasks and bringing the results
              together for reconciliation. While we're at it, let's also have
              this function determine whether the operation should be
              parallelized, or it should run synchronously in the main thread.
              First, let's look at the task itself that we'll want to run in
              parallel against each chunk of our data, as it's sliced up:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet5">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This task is kept separate from our worker code and other parts of
              our application that run in the main thread. The reason is that
              we'll want to use this function in both: the main thread and the
              worker threads. Now, we'll make a worker that can import this
              function, and use it with any data that gets passed to the worker
              in a message:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet6">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Earlier in the chapter, we implemented two utility functions. The
              <em>isConcurrent()</em> function determines the utility of running
              an operation as a set of smaller tasks in parallel. The other
              function, <em>getConcurrency()</em>, determines the level of
              concurrency that we should be running at. We'll use these two
              functions here, and we'll introduce two new utility functions. In
              fact, these are generators that will help us later on. Let's take
              a look at this:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet7">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              With these two generators in placeâ€”<em>workers</em> and
              <em>id</em>â€”we're now ready to implement our
              <em>parallel()</em> higher-order function. The idea is to take a
              function as input along with some other parameters that allows us
              to tune the behavior of the parallelization and return a new
              function that we can simply invoke as normal throughout our app.
              Let's take a look at this function now:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet8">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now we can use the <em>parallel()</em> function to build
              concurrent functions that are called all throughout our
              application. For example, the <em>sumConcurrent()</em> function
              can be used whenever we have to compute the sum of large inputs.
              The only thing that's different is the input data.

              <em
                >An obvious limitation here is that we only have a single

                book-keeping to be done hereâ€”having IDs to reconcile tasks with
                their operations is kind of painful; this feels as if we're
                implementing promises. This is because that's essentially what
                we're doing here. The next chapter dives into more detail on
                combining promises with workers to avoid messy abstractions,
                such as the one that we just implemented.</em

              In the previous section, you learned to create a generic function
              that will decide on the fly, how to divide and conquer using
              workers, or whether it's more beneficial to simply call the
              function in the main thread. Now that we have a generic
              parallelization mechanism in place, what kind of problems can we
              solve? In this section, we'll address the most typical concurrency
              scenarios that will benefit from a solid concurrency architecture.

            <h5>Embarrassingly parallel</h5>
            <p>
              A problem is embarrassingly parallel when it's obvious how the
              larger task can be broken down into smaller tasks. These smaller
              tasks don't depend on one another, which makes it even easier to
              start off a task that takes input and produces output without
              relying on the state of other workers. This again comes back to
              functional programming, and the idea of
              <span class="term" data-term="referentialTransparency"
                >referential transparency</span
              >
              and no side-effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are the types of problems we want to solve with
              concurrencyâ€”at least at first, during the difficult first
              implementation of our application. These are the low-hanging-fruit
              as far as concurrency problems go, and they should be easy for us
              to tackle without risking our ability to deliver functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last example that we implemented in the preceding section was
              an embarrassingly parallel problem, where we simply needed each
              subtask to add up the input values and return them. Global search,
              when the collection is large and unstructured, is another example
              of something that takes little effort on our part to divide into
              smaller tasks and reconcile them into a result. Searching large
              text inputs is a similar example. Mapping and reducing are yet
              another example of something that takes relatively little effort
              to parallelize.

            <h5>Searching collections</h5>
            <p>
              Some collections are sorted. These collections can be searched
              efficiently because binary search algorithms are able to avoid
              large sections of data simply based on the premise that the data
              is sorted. However, there are other times when we work with
              collections that are largely unstructured or unsorted. In other
              cases, the time complexity is likely to be O(n) because every item
              in the collection needs to be checked as no assumptions can be
              made.
            </p>
            <p>
              Large strings of text are a good example of a collection that's
              unstructured. If we were to search this text for a substring,
              there'd be no way to avoid searching a section of the text based
              on what we've found so farâ€”the whole search space needs to be
              covered. We also need to count the number of substring occurrences
              in a large body of text. This is an embarrassingly parallel
              problem. Let's write some code that counts the number of substring
              occurrences in string input. We'll reuse the parallel utilities
              that we created in the previous section, in particular, the
              <em>parallel()</em> function. Here's the task that we'll use:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet9">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now let's create a block of text for us to search and a parallel
              function to search it with:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet10">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here, we're splitting the input string into 20 character chunks,
              and searching for the input value <em>en</em>. There's 3 results
              found. Let's see if we can use this task, along with our parallel
              worker utilities and count the number of times an item appears in
              an array.
            </p>
            <div class="snippet11">

            </div>
            <p>
              Since we're generating this 10,000 element array using random
              integers, the output will differ with each run. However, what's
              nice about our parallel worker utilities is that we were able to
              call <em>arrayCount()</em> with a substantially larger chunk size.

                lot more difficult to solve using concurrency. Our worker nodes
                in the previous filtering code don't need to communicate with
                one another. If we have several worker nodes looking for a

              The <em>Array</em> primitive in JavaScript already has a

              that impact the scalability and performance of running a given
              operation against a given set of input data. It's the size of the
              data multiplied by the complexity of any task that's applied to
              each item within this data. These constraints can cause problems
              for our application if we're shoving tons of data into one array,
              then processing each array item with expensive code.

              of code examples can help us map one array to another without
              having to worry about the native <em>Array.map()</em> method
              running on a single CPUâ€”a potential bottleneck. We'll also address
              the issue of reducing large collections. It's a similar issue to
              mapping, only we use the <em>Array.reduce()</em> method. Here are
              the task functions:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet12">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Now we have generic functions that can be invoked from
              anywhereâ€”the main thread or from within a worker. We won't look at
              the worker code again because it uses the same pattern as the
              examples before this one. It figures out which task to invoke, and
              it handles formatting the response that's sent back to the main
              thread. Let's go ahead and use the <em>parallel()</em> utility to
              create a concurrent map and a concurrent reduce function:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet13">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Here, we create 75 tasks that are handed out to workers
              (75000/1000). Depending on our concurrency level, this means we'll
              have several property values being plucked from array items
              simultaneously. The reduce job works the same way; we sum the
              mapped collections concurrently. We still need to perform
              summation in the <em>sumConcurrent()</em> callback, but it's very
              few.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >We need to exercise caution when performing concurrent reduce
                jobs. Mapping is straightforward because we're creating what
                amounts to a clone of the original array in terms of size and
                ordering. It's just the values that differ. Reducing could be
                dependent on the result as it currently stands. Put differently,
                as each array item makes its way through the reduce function,
                the result, as it's being built-up, can change the final result
                outcome. Concurrency makes this difficult, but in this previous
                example, the problem was embarrassingly parallelâ€”not all reduce
                jobs are.</em

            <h5>Keeping the DOM responsive</h5>
            <p>
              So far in this chapter, the focus has been data-centricâ€”taking
              input and transforming it by using web workers to divide and
              conquer. This isn't the only use of worker threads; we can also
              use them to keep the DOM responsive for our users.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this section, we'll introduce a concept that's used in Linux
              kernel development to split events into phases for optimal
              performance. Then, we'll address the challenge of communicating
              between the DOM and our workers and vice-versa.

          <div id="bottom-halves">
            <h5>Bottom halves</h5>
            <p>
              The Linux kernel has the concept of top-halves and bottom-halves.
              This idea is used by the hardware interrupt request machinery. The
              problem is that hardware interrupts happen all the time, and it's
              the kernel's job to make sure they're all captured and processed
              in a timely-manner. To do this effectively, the kernel splits the
              task of processing a hardware interrupt into two halvesâ€”the top
              and bottom half.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's the job of the top-half to respond to external stimuli, such
              as a mouse click or a keystroke. However, there are severe
              limitations imposed on the top-half, and this is on purpose. The
              top-half portion of processing a hardware interrupt request can
              only schedule the real workâ€”the invocation of all the other system
              componentsâ€”for a later time. This later work is done in the
              bottom-half. The side-effect of this approach is that interrupts
              are handled swiftly at a low level, allowing more flexibility in
              terms of prioritizing events.
            </p>
            <p>
              What does kernel development have to do with JavaScript and
              concurrency? Well, it turns out that we can borrow these ideas,
              and have our "bottom-half" work be delegated to a worker. Our
              event-handling code that responds to the DOM events wouldn't
              actually do anything except for passing the message to the worker.
              This ensures that the main thread is only doing what it absolutely
              needs to do without any extra processing. This means that if the
              web worker comes back with something to display, it can do so
              immediately. Remember, the main thread includes the rendering
              engine, which blocks our code from running and vice-versa.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is run-to-completion, which we're well aware at this
              point. This means that less time spent in the top-half, is time
              that's spent responding to users by updating the screen. At the
              same time, JavaScript is also run-to-completion within the web
              worker where our bottom-halves run. This means that the same
              limitation applies here; if our worker gets 100 messages sent to
              it in a short period of time, they're processed in
              <strong>first in first out (FIFO)</strong> order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The difference is that since this code isn't running in the main
              thread, the UI components still respond when the user interacts
              with them. This is such a crucial factor in the perception of a
              quality product that it's worth the time investigating top-halves
              and bottom-halves. We now just need to figure out an
              implementation.

          <div id="translating-dom-manipulation">
            <h5>Translating DOM manipulation</h5>
            <p>
              If we treat web workers as the bottom-halves of our application,
              then we need a way to manipulate the DOM while spending as little
              time as possible in the top-half. That is, it's up to the worker
              to figure out what needs to change in the DOM tree and then to
              notify the main thread. Then, all that the main thread has to do
              is translate between the posted message and the required DOM API
              call. There's no fiddling around with data between receiving these
              messages and handing control off to the DOM; milliseconds are
              precious in the main thread.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's see how easy this is to implement. We'll start with the
              worker implementation that sends the DOM manipulation messages to
              the main thread when it wants to update something in the UI:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet14">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This work posts three messages back to the main thread. They're
              timed using <em>setTimeout()</em>, so we can expect to see a new
              list item be rendered every second until all three are displayed.
              Now, let's take a look at how the main thread code makes sense of
              these messages:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet15">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button><ul class="position-absolute" style="top: 38px; right: 0;" workerDom></ul></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As we can see, we're giving the top-half (the main thread) very
              little opportunity to bottleneck, causing the user interaction to
              freeze. It's quite simpleâ€”the only code that's executed here is
              the DOM manipulation code. This drastically increases the
              likelihood of completing quickly, allowing the screen to visibly
              update for the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              What about the other direction, getting external events into the
              system without interfering with the main thread? We'll look at
              this next.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="translating-dom-events">
            <h5>Translating DOM events</h5>
            <p>
              As soon as a DOM event is triggered, we want to hand off control
              to our web worker. This way, the main thread can continue as if
              nothing else is happeningâ€”everyone is happy. There's a little more
              to it than this unfortunately. For instance, we can't simply
              listen to every single event on every single element, forwarding
              each to the worker, that would defeat the purpose of not running
              code in the main thread if it's constantly responding to events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, we only want to listen to the DOM events that the worker
              cares about. This really is no different from how we would
              implement any other web application; our components listen to
              events they're interested in. To implement this with workers, we
              need a mechanism that tells the main thread to setup a DOM event
              listener on a particular element. Then, the worker can simply
              listen to incoming DOM events and react accordingly. Let's take a
              look at the worker implementation first:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet16">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              This worker asks the main thread, who has access to the DOM, to
              setup two event listeners. It then sets up its own event listener
              for the DOM events that eventually make their way to the worker.
              Let's take a look at the DOM code responsible for setting up
              handlers and forwarding events to the worker:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet17">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><div class="input-group position-absolute" style="width: 200px; top: 4px; right: 4px;">
                <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="W-input" workerDom>
                <div class="input-group-append">
                  <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary" type="button" workerDom>W-button</button>
                </div>
              </div></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              <em
                >For the sake of brevity, there's only a couple of event
                properties sent back to the worker. We can't send the event
                object as it is due to serialization limitations in web worker
                messages. In practice, this same pattern can be used, but we'll
                probably add more event properties to this, such as
                <em>clientX</em> and <em>clientY</em>.</em
              >
