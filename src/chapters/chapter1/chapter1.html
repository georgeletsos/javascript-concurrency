          <h4>Chapter 1: Why JavaScript Concurrency?</h4>
          <p>
            JavaScript is not a language associated with concurrency. In fact,
            it's frequently associated with the exact opposite—concurrency
            challenges. This has changed a lot over the past few years,
            especially with new language features in ES 2015. Promises have been
            used in JavaScript for many years; only now, they're a native type.
            Generators are another addition to the language that changes the way
            we think about concurrency in JavaScript. Web workers have been in
            browsers for several years, and yet, we don't see them used that
            often. Perhaps, it has less to do with workers and more about our
            understanding of the role that concurrency plays in our
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of this chapter is to explore some general concurrency
            ideas, starting with what, exactly, concurrency is. If you don't
            have any sort of concurrent programming in your background, it's
            fine because this chapter is a perfect starting point for you. If
            you've done concurrent programming in the past using JavaScript or
            some other language, think of this chapter as a refresher, only with
            JavaScript as the context.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll wrap up this chapter with some overarching concurrency
            principles. These are valuable programming tools that we should keep
            in the back of our heads while writing concurrent code. Once we have
            learned to apply these principles, they'll tell us whether we're on
            the right track with our concurrency design, or that we need to take
            a step back and ask ourselves what we're really trying to achieve.
            These principles take a top-down approach to the design of our
            application. This means that they're applicable from the very start,
            even before we've started writing any code. Throughout the book,
            we'll be referring to these principles, so if you only read one
            section in this chapter, make sure it's

            at the end.

            <h5>Synchronous JavaScript</h5>
            <p>
              Before we start conjuring large-scale concurrent JavaScript
              architectures, let's shift our attention to the good old
              synchronous JavaScript code that we're all familiar with. These
              are the blocks of JavaScript code that are called as the result of
              a click event, or run as the result of loading a webpage. Once
              they start, they don't stop. That is to say, they're
              <strong>run-to-completion</strong>. We'll dig into
              run-to-completion a little more in the following chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                We'll occasionally see the term <strong>synchronous</strong> and
                <strong>serial</strong> used interchangeably throughout the
                chapters. They're both referring to code statements that run one
                after another until there's nothing more to run.
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite JavaScript being designed as a single-threaded,
              run-to-completion environment, the nature of the web complicates
              this. Think about the web browser, and all it's moving parts.
              There's the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> for
              rendering user interfaces and
              <strong>XMLHttpRequest (XHR)</strong> objects for fetching remote
              data sources, to name a couple. Let's take a look at the
              synchronous nature of JavaScript and the asynchronous nature of
              the web.
            </p>

          <div id="synchronicity-is-easy-to-understand">
            <h5>Synchronicity is easy to understand</h5>
            <p>
              When code is synchronous, it's easier to understand. It's easier
              to mentally map the instructions that we're seeing on the screen
              to sequential steps in our heads; do this, then do that; check
              this, if true, do that, and so on. This type of serial processing
              is easy enough to understand, because there aren't any surprises,
              assuming the code isn't completely horrible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concurrent programming, on the other hand, isn't so easy to grasp.
              This is because there's no linear logic for us to follow in our
              code editors. Instead, we constantly jump around, trying to map
              what this piece of code is doing relative to that piece of code.
              Time is an important factor with concurrent designs; it is
              something that goes against the brain's natural way of
              comprehending code. When we read code, we naturally execute it in
              our heads. This is how we figure out what it's doing. This
              approach falls apart when the actual execution doesn't line up
              with what's in our head. Normally, code reads like a
              book—concurrent code is like a book where the pages are numbered,
              but out of order. Let's take a look at some trivial pseudo
              JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet1">
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code><button class="btn btn-secondary shadow-none run-code-button">Run</button></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              In traditional multi-threading environments, a thread is something
              that runs asynchronously with other threads. We use threads to
              take advantage of multiple CPUs found on most systems today,
              resulting in better performance. However, this comes at a cost
              because it forces us to rethink how our code is executed at
              runtime. It's no longer the usual step by step execution. This
              code could be running alongside other code in another CPU, or it
              could be competing with other threads for time on the same CPU.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of simplicity goes away when we introduce concurrency to
              synchronous code—it's the code equivalent of brain freeze. This is
              why we write concurrent code: code that makes an upfront
              assumption of concurrency. We'll elaborate on this concept as we
              progress through the book. With JavaScript, it's important to
              assume a concurrent design, because that's the way the web works.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="asynchronous-is-inevitable">
            <h5>Asynchronous is inevitable</h5>
            <p>
              The reason that concurrency in JavaScript is such an important
              idea is because the web is a concurrent place, both from a very
              high level and an implementation detail level. In other words, the
              web is concurrent because at any given point in time, there's
              oodles of data flowing over the miles of fiber, which encase the
              globe. It has to do with the applications themselves that are
              deployed to web browsers, and how the back-end servers handle the
              litany of requests for data.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="asynchronous-browsers">
            <h5>Asynchronous browsers</h5>
            <p>
              Let's take a closer look at the browser and the kinds of
              asynchronous actions found there. When a user loads a webpage, one
              of the first actions that the page will perform is to download and
              evaluate our JavaScript code that goes with the page. This in
              itself is an asynchronous action, because while our code
              downloads, the browser will continue doing other things, such as
              rendering page elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another asynchronous data source that arrives over the network is
              the application data itself. Once our page has loaded and our
              JavaScript code starts running, we'll need to display some data
              for the user. This is actually one of the first things that our
              code will do so that the user has something to look at right away.
              Again, while we're waiting on this data to arrive, the JavaScript
              engine will move our code right along to it's next set of
              instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the page elements have all been rendered and populated with
              data, the user starts interacting with our page. This means events
              are dispatched—clicking an element dispatches a click event. The
              DOM environment, where these events are dispatched from, is a
              sand-boxed environment. This means that within the browser, the
              DOM is a subsystem, separate from the JavaScript interpreter,
              which runs our code. This separation makes certain JavaScript
              concurrency scenarios especially difficult. We'll cover these in
              depth in the next chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
              With all these sources of asynchronicity, it's no wonder that our
              pages can become bloated with special case handling to deal with
              the edge cases that inevitably pop up. Thinking asynchronously
              isn't natural, so this type of monkey-patching is the likely
              result of thinking synchronously. It's best to embrace the
              asynchronous nature of the web. After all, a synchronous web can
              lead to unbearable user experiences. Now, let's dig a little
              further into the types of concurrency we're likely to face in our
              JavaScript architectures.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="types-of-concurrency">
            <h5>Types of concurrency</h5>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a run-to-completion language. There's no getting
              around it, despite any concurrency mechanisms that are thrown on
              top of it. In other words, our JavaScript code isn't going to
              yield control to another thread in the middle of an
              <em>if</em> statement. The reason this matters is so that we can
              pick a level of abstraction that makes sense in helping us think
              about JavaScript concurrency. Let's look at the two types of
              concurrent actions found in our JavaScript code.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="asynchronous-actions">
            <h5>Asynchronous actions</h5>
            <p>
              A defining characteristic of asynchronous actions is that they do
              not block other actions that follow. Asynchronous actions don't
              necessarily mean fire-and-forget. Rather, when the part of the
              action we're waiting on completes, we run a callback function.
              This callback function falls out of sync with the rest of our
              code; hence, the term asynchronous.
            </p>
            <p>
              In web front-ends, this generally means fetching data from a
              remote service. These fetching actions are relatively slow,
              because they have to traverse the network connection. It makes
              sense for these actions to be asynchronous, just because our code
              is waiting on some data to return so that it can fire a callback
              function, doesn't mean the user should have to sit around and wait
              too. Furthermore, it's unlikely that any screen that the user is
              currently looking at depends on only one remote resource. So,
              serially processing multiple remote fetch requests would have a
              detrimental effect on the user experience.
            </p>
            <p>Here's a general idea of what asynchronous code looks like:</p>
            <div class="snippet2">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              We're not limited to fetching remote data, as the single source of
              asynchronous actions. When we make network requests, these
              asynchronous control flows actually leave the browser. But what
              about asynchronous actions that are confined within the browser?
              Take the <em>setTimeout()</em> function as an example. It follows
              the same callback pattern that's used with network fetch requests.
              The function is passed a callback, which is executed at a later
              point. However, nothing ever leaves the browser. Instead, the
              action is queued behind any number of other actions. This is
              because asynchronous actions are still just one thread of control,
              executed by one CPU. This means that as our applications grow in
              size and complexity, we're faced with a concurrency scaling issue.
              But then, maybe asynchronous actions weren't meant to solve the
              single CPU problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps a better way to think about asynchronous actions performed
              on a single CPU is to picture a juggler. The juggler's brain is
              the CPU, coordinating his motor actions. The balls that get tossed
              around is the data our actions operate on. There's only two
              fundamental actions we care about—toss and catch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the juggler only has one brain, he can't possibly devote his
              mental capacity to perform more than one task at a time. However,
              the juggler is experienced and knows he doesn't need more than a
              tiny fraction of attention given to the toss or catch actions.
              Once the ball is in the air, he's free to return his attention to
              catching the ball that's about to land.

              To anyone observing this juggler in action, it appears as though
              he's paying full attention to all six balls, when in reality, he's
              ignoring five of them at any point in time.

            <h5>Parallel actions</h5>
            <p>
              Like asynchronicity, parallelism allows control flow to continue
              without waiting on actions to complete. Unlike asynchronicity,
              parallelism depends on hardware. This is because we can't have two
              or more flows of control taking place in parallel on a single CPU.
              However, the main aspect that sets parallelism apart from
              asynchronicity is the rationale for using it. The two approaches
              to concurrency solve different problems, and both require
              different design principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the day, we want to perform actions in parallel that
              would otherwise be time prohibitive, if performed synchronously.
              Think about a user who is awaiting three expensive actions to
              complete. If each takes 10 seconds to complete (an eternity on a
              UX timescale), then this means the user will have to wait for 30
              seconds. If we're able to perform these tasks in parallel, we can
              bring the aggregate wait time closer to 10 seconds. We get more
              for less, leading to a performant user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              None of this is free. Like asynchronous actions, parallel actions
              lead to callbacks as a communication mechanism. In general,
              designing for parallelism is hard, because in addition to
              communicating with worker threads, we have to worry about the task
              at hand, that is, what are we hoping to achieve by using worker
              threads? And how do we break down our problem into smaller
              actions? The following is a rough idea of what our code starts to
              look like when we introduce parallelism:
            </p>
            <div class="snippet3">
              <!-- prettier-ignore -->
              <pre><code class="code-block javascript"></code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              Don't worry about the mechanics of what's happening with this
              code, as they'll all be covered in depth later on. The takeaway is
              that as we throw workers into the mix, we add more callbacks to an
              environment that's already polluted with them. This is why we have
              to design for parallelism in our code, which is a major focus of
              this book, starting in
              <a href="../chapter4/chapter5.html">
                Chapter 5, Working with Workers</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's think about the juggler analogy from the preceding section.
              The toss and catch actions are performed asynchronously by the
              juggler; that is, he has only one brain/ CPU. But suppose the
              environment around us is constantly changing. There's a growing
              audience for our juggling act and a single juggler can't possibly
              keep them all entertained.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solution is to introduce more jugglers to the act. This way we
              add more computing power capable, of performing multiple toss and
              catch actions in the same instant. This simply isn't possible with
              a single juggler running asynchronously.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not out of the woods yet, because we can't just have the
              newly-added jugglers stand in one place, and perform their act the
              same way our single juggler did. The audience is larger, more
              diverse, and needs to be entertained. The jugglers need to be able
              to handle different items. They need to move around on the floor
              so that the various sections of the audience are kept happy. They
              might even start juggling with each other. It's up to us to
              produce a design that's capable of orchestrating this juggling
              act.

              JavaScript concurrency principles: Parallelize, Synchronize,
              Conserve
            </h5>
            <p>
              Now that we've been through the basics of what concurrency is, and
              its role in front-end web development, let's look at some
              fundamental concurrency principles of JavaScript development.
              These principles are merely tools that inform our design choices
              when we write concurrent JavaScript code.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we apply these principles, they force us to step back and ask
              the appropriate questions before we move forward with
              implementation. In particular, they're the why and how questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Why are we implementing this concurrent design?</li>
              <li>
                What do we hope to get out of it that we couldn't otherwise get
                out of a simpler synchronous approach?
              </li>
              <li>
                How do we implement concurrency in a way that's unobtrusive to
                the features of our applications?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="parallelize">
            <h5>Parallelize</h5>
            <p>
              The parallelize principle means taking advantage of modern CPU
              capabilities to compute results in less time. This is now possible
              in any modern browser or NodeJS environment. In the browser, we
              can achieve true parallelism using web workers. In Node, we can
              achieve true parallelism by spawning new processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the goal being more computations in less time, we must now
              ask ourselves why we want to do this? Besides the fact that raw
              performance is super cool in it's own right, there has to be some
              tangible impact for the user. This principle makes us look at our
              parallel code and ask—what does the user get out of this? The
              answer is that we can compute using larger data sets as input, and
              have a smaller opportunity of an unresponsive user experience due
              to long-running JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's important to scrutinize the tangible benefit of going
              parallel because when we do so, we add complexity to our code that
              wouldn't otherwise be there. So if the user sees the same result
              no matter what we do, the parallelize principle probably isn't
              applicable. On the other hand, if scalability is important and
              there's a strong possibility of growing data set sizes, the trade
              off of code simplicity for parallelism is probably worthwhile.
              Here's a checklist to follow when thinking about the parallelize
              principle:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Does our application perform expensive computations against
                large data sets?
              </li>
              <li>
                As our data sets grow in size, is there potential for processing
                bottlenecks that negatively impact the user experience?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do our users currently experience bottlenecks in our
                application's performance?
              </li>
              <li>
                How feasible is parallelism in our design, given other
                constraints? What are the trade-offs?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do the benefits of our concurrency implementation outweigh the
                overhead costs, either in terms of user-perceived latency or in
                terms of code maintainability?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="synchronize">
            <h5>Synchronize</h5>
            <p>
              The synchronize principle is about the mechanisms used to
              coordinate concurrent actions and the abstractions of those
              mechanisms. Callback functions are a JavaScript notion with deep
              roots. It's the obvious tool of choice when we need to run some
              code, but we don't want to run it now. We want to run it when some
              condition becomes true. By and large, there's nothing inherently
              wrong with this approach. Used in isolation, the callback pattern
              is probably the most succinct, readable concurrency pattern that
              we can use. Callbacks fall apart when there are plenty them, and
              lots of dependencies between them.

          </div>

          <div id="the-promise-api">
            <h5>The Promise API</h5>
            <p>
              The Promise API is the core JavaScript language construct,
              introduced in ECMAScript 6 to address the synchronization woes
              faced by every application on the planet. It's a simple API that
              actually makes use of callbacks (yes, we're fighting callbacks
              with callbacks). The aim of promises isn't to eliminate callbacks,
              it's to remove the unnecessary callbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              What's crucial about promises is that they're a generic
              synchronization mechanism. This means that they're not
              specifically made for network requests, web workers, or DOM
              events. We, the programmers, have to wrap our asynchronous actions
              with promises and resolve them as necessary. The reason why this
              is a good thing is because the callers that rely on the promise
              interface don't care about what's going on inside the promise. As
              the name implies, it's a promise to resolve a value at some point.
              This could be in 5 seconds or immediately. The data can come from
              a network resource or a web worker. The caller doesn't care,
              because it makes an assumption of concurrency, which means we can
              fulfill it any in way we like without breaking the application.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we learn to treat values as values at some point in the
              future, concurrent code is suddenly much more approachable.
              Promises, and similar mechanisms, can be used to synchronize just
              network requests, or just web worker events. But their real power
              is using them to write concurrent applications, where concurrency
              is the default. Here's a checklist to reference when thinking
              about the synchronize principle:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Does our application heavily rely on callback functions as a
                synchronization mechanism?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do we often have to synchronize more than one asynchronous event
                such as network requests?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do our callback functions contain more synchronization
                boilerplate code than application code?
              </li>
              <li>
                What kind of assumptions does our code make about the
                concurrency mechanisms that drive asynchronous events?
              </li>
              <li>
                If we had a magic kill concurrency button, would our application
                still behave as expected?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div id="conserve">
            <h5>Conserve</h5>
            <p>
              The conserve principle is about saving on compute and memory
              resources. This is done by using <em>lazy</em> evaluation
              techniques. The name <em>lazy</em> stems from the idea that we
              don't actually compute a new value until we're sure we actually
              need it. Imagine an application component that renders page
              elements. We can pass this component the exact data that it needs
              to render. This means that several computations take place before
              the component actually needs it. It also means that the data
              that's used needs to be allocated into memory, so that we can pass
              it to the component. There's nothing wrong with this approach. In
              fact, it's the standard way to pass data around in our JavaScript
              components.
            </p>
            <p>
              The alternative approach uses lazy evaluation to achieve the same
              result. Rather than computing the values to be rendered, then
              allocating them in a structure to be passed, we compute one item,
              and then render it. Think of this as a kind of cooperative
              multi-tasking, where the larger action is broken down into smaller
              tasks that pass the focus of control back and forth.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's two undesirable aspects to the standard approach. First,
              the transformation happens up-front, which could be a costly
              computation. What happens if the component is unable to render it
              for whatever reason—due to some constraint? Then we've performed
              this computation to transform data that wasn't needed. As a
              corollary, we've allocated a new data structure for the
              transformed data so that we could pass it to our component. This
              transient memory structure doesn't really serve any purpose, as
              it's garbage-collected immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using the lazy approach, we're able to remove the expensive
              transform computation that happens up-front. Instead, we transform
              only one item at a time. We're also able to remove the up-front
              allocation of the transformed data structure. Instead, only the
              transformed item is passed into the component. Then, the component
              can ask for another item or stop. The conserve principle uses
              concurrency as a means to only compute what's needed and only
              allocate memory that's needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following checklist will help us think about the conserve
              principle when writing concurrent code:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Are we computing values that are never used?</li>
              <li>
                Do we only allocate data structures as a means to pass them from
                one component to the next?
              </li>
              <li>Do we chain-together data transformation actions?</li>
